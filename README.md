# Decentralized Galactic Civilization Archive (DGCA)

A collaborative platform for documenting, preserving, and exploring hypothetical alien civilizations across the galaxy through decentralized technologies.

## Overview

The Decentralized Galactic Civilization Archive (DGCA) is a distributed database system that enables participants to collaboratively create, maintain, and explore detailed records of hypothetical alien civilizations. By leveraging blockchain technology and smart contracts, DGCA ensures transparent, immutable documentation of civilizations, their histories, artifacts, and inter-species relations.

## Core Features

### Civilization Database
- Detailed profiles of alien civilizations including biology, culture, technology, and societal structure
- Temporal mapping of evolutionary and technological advancement
- Geographic data mapping civilizations across galactic sectors
- Cross-referencing system to track inter-civilization interactions and influences

### Smart Contract Infrastructure
- Automated verification of historical consistency
- Reputation-based contribution system
- Conflict resolution protocols for competing historical narratives
- Automated translation matrices for cross-species communication records

### Digital Artifacts System
- NFT-based representation of significant historical artifacts
- Provenance tracking for archaeological discoveries
- Interactive 3D models of architectural and technological achievements
- Virtual museum spaces for curated collections

### Governance Framework
- Decentralized voting on historical accuracy
- Expert panels for specialized knowledge domains
- Community-driven content moderation
- Incentive structures for quality contributions

## Technical Architecture

### Backend Components
- IPFS-based distributed storage for civilization data
- EVM-compatible blockchain for smart contract execution
- OrbitDB for peer-to-peer database replication
- AI-powered consistency verification engine

### Frontend Interface
- Interactive galactic map
- Civilization timeline viewer
- Archaeological artifact explorer
- Governance participation portal

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Web3 wallet with support for EVM-compatible networks
- IPFS node (optional for full node operators)
- Modern web browser with WebGL support

### Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/dgca/galactic-archive
cd galactic-archive
npm install
npm run setup
```

### Configuration
1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
2. Configure your preferred RPC endpoint
3. Set up IPFS gateway connections
4. Initialize local database

## Contributing

### Adding a New Civilization
1. Fork the repository
2. Create a new branch for your civilization
3. Fill out the civilization template
4. Submit a pull request with supporting documentation

### Artifact Submission
1. Prepare 3D models and metadata
2. Submit verification proof
3. Mint NFT through the artifact contract
4. Link to relevant civilization records

## Community Guidelines

### Historical Accuracy
- All submissions must include logical reasoning for historical claims
- Cross-reference existing civilizations when documenting interactions
- Provide evidence for technological capability claims
- Maintain internal consistency in civilization development

### Governance Participation
- Vote on proposed historical revisions
- Participate in expert panel discussions
- Submit improvement proposals
- Report inconsistencies or violations
